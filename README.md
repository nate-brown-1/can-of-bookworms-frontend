### Cooperative

#### Make a list of each parson’s strengths

Trey: Determination, axios
Nate: Comfortable with WRRC cycle / servers / back end

#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

We will utilize each other's strengths to improve our individual areas that need it.

#### In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Trey: WRRC, Documentation
Nate: React front end, Documentation

#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

Develop front and back end concurrently and collaboratively in order to make them talk to each other without problems.

### Conflict Resolution

#### What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

We will talk it over and reassess our strategy.

#### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

The non-contributing member will demand more responsibility and ensure that their voice is heard and they are seen.

#### How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We will view the project as a learning experience for both members of the group.
